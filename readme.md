## Decision tree algorithm from scratch


This script creates a decision tree for the data present in a csv file

To run the code, give the following command
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
python decisiontree.py --data <PathToData> --output <PathToOutputFile>
```

Two data sets are given named car.csv and nursery.csv which can be used in this program

For example, the script can be run as follows 
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
python decisiontree.py --data car.csv --output yourname.xml
```

Output will be stored in a csv file mentioned at the end of execution in the form of a xml file
